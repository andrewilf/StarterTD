# S1075: URIs should not be hardcoded
# (You often hardcode file paths for assets in MonoGame)
dotnet_diagnostic.S1075.severity = none

# S109: Magic numbers should not be used
# (Gamedev uses magic numbers for offsets/UI constantly. This silences that noise.)
dotnet_diagnostic.S109.severity = none

# S1104: Fields should not have public accessibility
# (In simple ECS or Game components, public fields are often preferred for performance/serialization)
dotnet_diagnostic.S1104.severity = suggestion

# S2933: Fields that are only assigned in the constructor should be 'readonly'
# (Useful, but sometimes noisy if you reset state in an Init() method)

# S3897: Classes that implement IEquatable<T> should be sealed
# (MonoGame structs/classes often implement this for performance)
